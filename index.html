  <h2>Loopover God's Number Upper Bounds</h2>
  
  Loopover is like a 2D version of a Rubik's cube (you can play it at https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/580366/ or https://loopover.xyz/).

  One interesting problem is to find what the largest number of moves would be if every scramble of a NxN Loopover is solved as efficiently as possible. This is called the God's number. I, and other people on the internet, have been working on this problem for over a year (my code is at https://github.com/coolcomputery/Loopover-Brute-Force-and-Improvement on my other account).

  Currently, we know that God's number for 4x4 is between 18 and 22.
